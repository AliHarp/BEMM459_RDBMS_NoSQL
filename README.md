# BEMM459_RDBMS_NoSQL

For code associated with BEMM459, please click the relevant folder (code is organised by weeks).
Binder link was available for Week 1, but has now been removed. This is because we will be learning database and which also requires RDBMS and NoSQL software and related persistent datastore. This is available only through Exeter's Windows Virtual Desktop.
