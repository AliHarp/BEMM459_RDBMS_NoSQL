# BEMM459_RDBMS_NoSQL

For code associated with BEMM459, please click the relevant folder (code is organised by weeks).
Binder link was available for Week 1 but has now been removed. As you will be learning databases, you will work with relational and NoSQL database software, which have already been pre-installed and made available through Exeter's Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD). Binder will not provide you access to these databases or persistent storage. Therefore, please only use WVD.
